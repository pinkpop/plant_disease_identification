# plant_disease_identification
an ai model which can identify disease type of plant leaves


This is an AI contest for the employees of my current company to showcase their skills in artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
The goal of this project is to accurately identify the type of a plant leave, specifically if it is healthy, angular_leaf_spot, or bean_rust. 

I used tensorflow/keras to build a model with training data.(200 pics/ class)
